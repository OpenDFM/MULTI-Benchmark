## üìñ Overview

Rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) highlights the need to introduce challenging yet realistic benchmarks to the academic community, while existing benchmarks primarily focus on understanding simple natural images and short context. In this paper, we present***MULTI***, as a cutting-edge benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on understanding complex tables and images, and reasoning with long context. **MULTI** provides multimodal inputs and requires responses that are either precise or open-ended, reflecting real-life examination styles. **MULTI** includes over 18,000 questions and challenges MLLMs with a variety of tasks, ranging from formula derivation to image detail analysis and cross-modality reasoning. We also introduce***MULTI-Elite***, a 500-question selected hard subset, and ***MULTI-Extend***, with more than 4,500 external knowledge context pieces. Our evaluation indicates significant potential for MLLM advancement, with GPT-4V achieving a **63.7%** accuracy rate on **MULTI**, in contrast to other MLLMs scoring between **28.5%** and **55.3%**. **MULTI** serves not only as a robust evaluation platform but also paves the way for the development of expert-level AI.

## ‚è¨ Download

You can download the dataset from the [HuggingFace Page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDFM/MULTI-Benchmark). Current [version](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDFM/MULTI-Benchmark/blob/main/MULTI_v1.2.2_20240212_release.zip) is `v1.2.2`. Unzip the files and put them under `data`.

```
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDFM/MULTI-Benchmark/resolve/main/MULTI_v1.2.2_20240212_release.zip
unzip MULTI_v1.2.2_20240212_release.zip -d ./data/
```

The structure of `data` should be something like:

```
data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images                                       # folder containing images
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ problem_v1.2.2_20240212_release.json         # MULTI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge_v1.2.2_20240212_release.json       # MULTI-Extend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hard_list_v1.2.1_20240206.json               # MULTI-Elite
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ captions_v1.2.0_20231217.csv                 # image captions generated by BLIP-6.7b
```

## üìù How to Evaluate

We provide a unified evaluation framework in `eval`. Each file in `eval/models` contains an evaluator specified to one M/LLM, and implements a `generate_answer` method to receive a question as input and give out the answer of it.

```shell
cd eval
python eval.py -h # to list all supported arguments
python eval.py -l # to list all supported models
```

### Environment Preparation Before Usage

Each evaluator requires its unique environment setting, and a universal environment may not work for all evaluators. **Just follow the official guide.** If the corresponding model runs well, then so should it fit in our framework.

You just need to install another two packages to run the evaluation code:

```shell
pip install tiktoken tqdm
```

If you just want to generate data for a specific setting (using `--debug` argument), this line above is all you need.

### Running Evaluation

For a quick start, see these examples:

Test GPT-4V model on whole MULTI with multimodal input, using MULTI-Extend as external knowledge:

```shell
python eval.py \
  --problem_file ../data/problem_v1.2.2_20240212_release.json \
  --knowledge_file ../data/knowledge_v1.2.2_20240212_release.json \
  --questions_type 0,1,2,3 \
  --image_type 0,1,2 \
  --input_type 2 \
  --model gpt-4v \
  --model_version gpt-4-vision-preview \
  --api_key sk-************************************************
```

Test Qwen-VL model on MULTI-Elite with image caption input, skip all questions not containing images, evaluate only multiple-choice questions, automatically set cuda device:

```shell
python eval.py \
  --problem_file ../data/problem_v1.2.2_20240212_release.json \
  --subset ../data/hard_list_v1.2.1_20240206.json \
  --caption_file ../data/captions_v1.2.0_20231217.csv \
  --questions_type 0,1 \
  --image_type 1,2 \
  --input_type 1 \
  --model qwen-vl \
  --model_dir ../models/Qwen-VL-Chat
```

The evaluation script will generate a folder named `results` under the root directory, and the result will be saved in `../results/EXPERIMENT_NAME`. During the evaluation, the script will save checkpoints in `../results/EXPERIMENT_NAME/checkpoints`, you can delete them after the evaluation is done. If the evaluation is interrupted, you can continue from the last checkpoint:

```shell
python eval.py \
  --checkpoint_dir ../results/EXPERIMENT_NAME
```

Most of the arguments are saved in `../results/EXPERIMENT_NAME/args.json`, so you can continue the evaluation without specifying all the arguments again. Please note that `--api_key` is not saved in `args.json` for security reasons, so you need to specify it again.

```shell
python eval.py \
  --checkpoint_dir ../results/EXPERIMENT_NAME \
  --api_key sk-************************************************
```

For more details of arguments, please use `python eval.py -h`, and refer to `args.py` and `eval.py`.

### Add Support for Your Models

It's recommended to read the code of the other given evaluators in `eval/models` before your implementation.  

Create `class YourModelEvaluator` and implement `generate_answer(self, question:dict)` to match the design supported in `eval.py` and `eval.sh`, which is anticipated to largely ease the coding process.

**Do not forget to add their references into `args.py` for the convenience of usage.** 

You can execute `model_tester.py` in the `eval` folder to check the correctness of you implementation. Various problems including implementation errors, small bugs in code, and even wrong environment settings may cause failure of the evaluation. The examples provided in the file cover most kinds of cases presented in our benchmark. Feel free to change the code in it to debug your codeüòä

```shell
python model_tester.py <args> # args are similar to the default settings above
```

### Create Captions and OCR Data for Images

Generate captions or OCR data for images, and save them in csv with format below:

```
../data/images/czls/502_1.png,a cartoon drawing of a man standing in front of a large block
../data/images/czls/525_1.png,a chinese newspaper with the headline, china's new year
...
```

We provide two example scripts to generate captions (`image_caption.py`) and OCR data  (`image_ocr.py`) for images.

## üìÆ How to Submit

You need to first prepare a UTF-8 encoded JSON file with the following format:

```
{
    "czsx_0_0": {
        "question_id": "czsx_0_0",
        "question_image_number": 1,
        "image_list": [...],            # optional
        "input_message": ...,           # optional
        "prediction": "C"
    },
    ...
}
```

If you evaluate the model with our official code, you can simply zip the experiment result folder `results/EXPERIMENT_NAME`.

Then, you can submit your result to our [evaluation platform](https://wj.sjtu.edu.cn/q/89UmRAJn) (Coming Soon).

You are also welcome to pull a request and contribute your code to our evaluation code. We will be very grateful for your contribution!

**[Notice]** Thank you for being so interested in the **MULTI** dataset! As the automated evaluation platform is not yet online, please fill in [this questionnaire](https://wj.sjtu.edu.cn/q/89UmRAJn) to get the evaluation results, your information will be kept strictly confidential, so please feel free to fill it out. ü§ó
